# MathToolkit-C

Welcome to MathToolkit-C, a comprehensive collection of mathematical solutions implemented in C programming language. This repository provides efficient algorithms and functions to solve a variety of mathematical problems, including Chinese Remainder, polynomial roots, quadratic equations, and greatest common divisor (GCD) calculations.

## Features

- *Chinese Remainder Solver:* Quickly find solutions to simultaneous congruence equations using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
- *Polynomial Root Finder:* Discover all roots of any degree polynomial using efficient root-finding algorithms.
- *Quadratic Equation Solver:* Solve quadratic equations and find complex or real roots.
- *GCD Calculator:* Compute the greatest common divisor of two or more integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `ChineseRemainder`: Contains the implementation of Chinese Remainder algorithms.
- `PolynomialRoots`: Includes functions to find all roots of polynomials.
- `QuadraticEquation`: Provides algorithms for solving quadratic equations.
- `GCD`: Contains functions to calculate the greatest common divisor.

## Usage

Each directory within the repository contains a separate C file along with any necessary auxiliary files. You can navigate to the specific directory of interest to find the corresponding solution. Each file includes detailed comments explaining the algorithm and usage.

To use the functions in your own project, simply copy the desired source files and include them in your C programming environment. Make sure to adhere to the appropriate license (if any) included in the repository.
